I have developed multiple AI-driven projects utilizing **IBM WatsonX** technologies:

1. **WatsonX.AI + Watson Assistant Integration**  
   Built a unified solution by integrating **WatsonX.AI** with **Watson Assistant**, enhancing conversational AI capabilities with advanced data analysis and contextual understanding.

2. **Neural Seek + Watson Assistant + Watson Discovery**  
   Implemented **Neural Seek** alongside Watson Assistant and Watson Discovery to create a smart, searchable platform for real-time data extraction using neural networks and natural language processing.

3. **Streamlit Interface for WatsonX Foundational Models**  
   Developed a **Streamlit** interface for users to interact with WatsonX foundational models, simplifying complex AI model usage for real-time applications in research and analytics.

4. **Research Paper Query with WatsonX**  
   Built an API-driven platform to interact with research papers hosted on **arXiv** through **WatsonX** models. The system allows for intelligent querying of vast academic datasets, delivering structured insights.

## Cloud Infrastructure & AWS Solutions

I have experience managing and deploying scalable applications using **AWS** services, ensuring high availability, security, and cost-efficiency. Key AWS projects include:

1. **Amazon S3 for Static Website Hosting**  
   Utilized **S3** for hosting static websites and applications. Integrated **CloudFront** for content delivery optimization and **Route 53** for domain management, ensuring global availability.

2. **Amazon EC2 for Scalable Application Hosting**  
   Designed and deployed applications using **EC2** instances, incorporating **auto-scaling**, **load balancing**, and optimized cost models. Built CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployments using **CodeDeploy** and **CodePipeline**.

3. **VPC for Secure Cloud Networking**  
   Created **Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)** for secure network isolation and managed **subnets**, **internet gateways**, and **NAT gateways** for routing. Implemented strict security controls with **IAM roles** and **security groups** to safeguard cloud resources.

## Kubernetes and OpenShift for Containerized Workloads

My expertise in **Kubernetes** and **OpenShift** involves orchestrating containerized applications for scalability and resilience. 

1. **Kubernetes-based Microservice Architecture**  
   Designed and deployed a microservices architecture on **Kubernetes** clusters, managing application scaling and ensuring smooth rollouts with zero downtime. Leveraged **Helm charts** for package management and **Prometheus** for monitoring.

2. **OpenShift for Hybrid Cloud Deployments**  
   Used **OpenShift** to build, deploy, and manage applications in a hybrid cloud environment. Deployed **CI/CD pipelines** with Jenkins, enabling automated container builds and deployments. Managed resource quotas, build configurations, and container health checks for enterprise-level applications.

3. **Docker & Containerization**  
   Containerized multiple applications using **Docker**, streamlining the development and deployment process. Created **Dockerfiles**, optimized images, and integrated Docker into Kubernetes for seamless deployment workflows.

## Full-Stack Development with MERN

My full-stack development experience focuses on the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), where I have developed several dynamic web applications:

1. **E-Commerce Platform**  
   Built a full-featured e-commerce web application with user authentication, product catalog, cart, and checkout features. Integrated third-party APIs for payment processing and shipping logistics.

2. **Portfolio Website**  
   Designed and deployed a personal portfolio website using HTML/CSS and **React.js** to showcase projects, integrating CI/CD workflows for smooth updates.
